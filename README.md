# rqt_captcha_task
For Dan's study

To run: 
rqt --standalone rqt_captcha_task

The person running the user study should input a unique participant ID. This will be the filename.
The participant can practice a few times without being recorded and when the experimenter clicks "Start Task", the app will record starting with the captcha currently shown.
The program saves csv files of the time, the user input and the real captcha value respectively.
